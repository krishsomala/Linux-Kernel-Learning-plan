# Linux-Kernel-Learning-plan
docs and other code samples for a learning plan for linux kernel internals, specifically targetting the ARM archirecture.
Addresses advanced topics such eBPF.
Hands-on exercises for building,  testing  and debugging with a remoted debugger (kgdb) on a Raspberry Pi 4 or higher target.
Instructions cater to an Linux x86 host or Macbook with Apple Silicon.


Having written code and worked on the kernel writing KLMs, networking code, user mode drivers for custom ASICs, FPGAs on a PowerPc and x86 targets in older versions of the kernel, 
I am not a complete newbie to the Linux kernel development.
I created this doc as a structured guide to help me get reaquanted with the lastest state of the art in the Linux kernel internals, familiarize myself with the major updates that happened in the kernel.
Also, as a refresher for the Linux on the ARM target.
I wanted to do some hands on coding, testing and debugging exercises on a real ARM target, for which I am using a Raspberry Pi4 module.

Caveat emptor: 
I have not tested any of the instructions on a x86 Linux machine and will not have time to do that in the near future.
At the time of writing this doc, I have embarked on my journey to get reaquainted with the Linux Kernel and learn its implementation for the ARM architecture.
I will update the doc as I traverse my learning path.
